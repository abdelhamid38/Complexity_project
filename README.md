We have to develop a simple application that search for an image from a folder in our desktop. :computer:

### :warning: Firstly
 we have to talk about our mechanism to resolve our problem, which is searching for a specific image using some hint writing in a text file with our description of these images.



### :white_check_mark: Our mechanism:

- List all files in the folder.
- take the word from the input form and search for it in the text file; if we find it we will display the image which has a relative with this file.
-if we complete our search for it, and we find    less than ten images we will search for the plural or singular of it, and relative images
